# Renewable Energy: Physics and Technology

Welcome to Professor Ghoniem's course on the physics and technology of renewable energy sources. The course provides introductory-level tutorials on the
conversion principles and technologies in various renewable energy sources,
such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. We examine the
issues involved in the thermodynamics, design, and operation of three
main systems: solar, biomass, and hydro-power.
