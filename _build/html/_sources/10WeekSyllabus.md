# Your Instructor

Professor Ghoniem joined the faculty at UCLA in 1977 as an Assistant
Professor after finishing his Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the
University of Wisconsin, Madison. He was promoted to Associate Professor
in 1982, Full Professor in 1986, Senior Professor in 1996, and
'Distinguished Professor' in 2006. Currently, he is a "Distinguished
Research Professor" with dual appointments in the departments of
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Materials Science &
Engineering at UCLA. He has wide experience developing
materials in extreme environments (Nuclear, Mechanical, and Aerospace).
He is a fellow of the American Nuclear Society, the American Academy of
Mechanics, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Japan
Society for Promotion of Science, and the Materials Research Society.

He was the general chair of the Second International Multiscale
Materials Modeling Conference in 2004 and the chair of the 19$^{th}$
International Conference on Fusion Reactor Materials in 2019. He serves
on the editorial boards of several journals and has published over 350
articles, 10 edited books, and is the co-author of a two-volume book
(Oxford Press) on the mechanics and physics of defects, computational
materials science, radiation interaction with materials, instabilities,
and self-organization in non-equilibrium materials (Oxford Press, 2007,
1100 pages - [Instabilities and Self-Organization in Materials](https://www.amazon.com/Instabilities-Self-Organization-Materials-Monographs-Chemistry/dp/0199298688)). He supervised and mentored 45 Ph.D. students and 30
postdoctoral scholars. Sixteen of his former students and postdocs are professors in various universities around the world, and many are technology leaders in the United States.

# Course Overview and Objectives

The Renewable Energy course provides introductory-level tutorials on
conversion principles and technologies in various renewable energy sources,
such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. We examine the
issues involved in the thermodynamics, design, and operation of three
main systems: solar, biomass, and hydropower. We also discuss the integration of various renewable energy
sources and their economics. At the completion of this course you will
be able to:

-   Understand the principles of operation of several clean energy
    technologies.

-   Analyze the "system" aspects of clean energy technologies.

-   Realize the technical and economic challenges of each system.

-   Learn the fundamental principles of thermodynamic energy conversion.

Students are expected to spend 90 minutes per week with the instructor
and an additional 1-2 hours per week on homework assignments.

## Required Textbook

1.  Peake, Stephen. *Renewable Energy: Power for a Sustainable Future*,
    Fourth Edition, 2018, **Oxford University Press**, EISBN
    978-0-19-253777-5. 2012.

2.  Online lesson content: All other materials are available online
    through the Neoscholar course website.

## Assignments

Various assignments will be given to students to enhance their learning
experience and understanding. These include:

-   **Homework Assignments**: Homework assignments will cover material
    from multiple lessons per assignment.

-   **Midterm**: An open-book midterm exam will be held midway through
    the course.

-   **Final Assignment**: A literature review assignment on a list of
    topics provided by the professor will be given on the last day of
    class. Students will be required to submit a 500-word abstract
    summarizing the assigned topic. All assignments will be graded by
    the teaching assistant.
